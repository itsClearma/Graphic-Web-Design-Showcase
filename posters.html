            <h3>True/False film festival!</h3>
            <p>I used mutliple film related items with the logo to make simple, bold designs. I used the Verdana font in all of them for its clear readability and to blend in with the T/F in the logo. I paid a lot of attention to angling, to keep a cohesive direction.</p>
            <br>

                <div class="posterContainer">
                    <p class="caption">With contrast, I tried to remember more than just colour but also size and amount of intricacies. I modelled the shape of the text close to the fibonacci sequence to make the text 'flow' more natural.</p>
                    <h4>Contrast</h4>

                    <img class="poster" src="Posters/AlignmentPoster.png">
                    <h4>Grid</h4>
                    <p class="caption">I thought the details of a clapperboard most suited the grid prompt. The slash in the title, the shadow and the 'Film Festival' text to give the sense of movement and sound. The slanted stripes were a little difficult to align perfectly but were well worth it.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="posterContainer">
                    <p class="caption">I repeated the title above and below a megaphone, the words less clear moving away from it like its getting quieter or less discernable. I extended the red from the logo to make the red rectangles that show the amplification of the megaphone.</p>
                    <h4>Repetition</h4>
                    <img class="poster" src="Posters/RepetitionPoster.png">
                </div>
                <div class="posterContainer">
                    <img class="poster" src="Posters/ProximityPoster.png">
                    <h4>Proximity</h4>
                    <p class="caption">I had the most trouble with this one, but I was able to split up the details well with the change in colours. I'm most happy with the inverted on the film reel that makes the slash, also looking like lighting behind the camera. I lined up the connecting sentence of the description paragraphs to not have their proximity throw it off.</p>
