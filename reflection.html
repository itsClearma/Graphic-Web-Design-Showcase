                <p>This module has expanded my knowledge on making websites and taught me Adobe tools I have never used before. I enjoyed learning about design in the posters, typography and the layout of the website itself. About proportion and empty space, and learning about flexboxes, as prior I would make tables to organise areas of text and images which isn't nearly as efficient or flexible.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I first got through the coding worksheets mainly since they could be objectively completed, and would set me up for the website later. My main aforementioned advancement being flexboxes but also aligning or spacing out elements.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I then finished off the typographic works, a strict set of rules made me think outside of the box and ensure I go for the less is more approach. After seeing the works in person and looking at a few extra on Rinko Kawauchi's website, it gave me further direction on what I could make with very little. Experimenting with shapes and making (one) very distinct colour choice each, forced me to be a bit more calculated with my choices. My proudest work would probably be the radial composition.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I started drafting the website and got a bit carried away with ideas. I ended up going back to my first initial idea for making it my website look like an organised portfolio, after the zanier ideas got a bit to overcomplicated. (A retro site where each section was a tab you could minimise/maximise/delete and another where the user would click or press keys to operate a Gameboy to navigate through my gallery.)</p> 
                <br>
                <p>I found the posters the most difficult, with there being less options and the feature definitions being a lot more open than the typographic systems'. There is a lot of overlap with them all having the same three colours and same Verdana font. With there also being multiple artists involved since its a whole festival, I decided to focus on what they'd all, inherently have in common, filmmaking. Thus I came up with reels, a clapperboard, a megaphone and camera as my key subjects. My favourite ends up being the clapperboard one since the others feel a bit overcrowded.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Finally, putting the whole website together felt great. The loading time is decent and I've kept it organised. I'm very satisfied with the flexing capabilities although I recognise that my site doesn't really work on a phone given a lot of the art pieces get cropped out significantly. I can say with certainty though that any screen bigger than an iPad can view my site well. I've enjoyed picking out a colour palette and making my site a little animated with hover effects on buttons. I ensured navigation works between pages and opens a new page for the coding worksheets. One of my last touches was the back to top button, especially for the longer pages, but placed anyway for shorter ones. Overall I have enjoyed this and look forward to improving my visual design as well as functional design. Hope to use some Javascript with HTML/CSS next semester!</p>
