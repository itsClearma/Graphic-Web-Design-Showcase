            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <h3>Rinko Kawauchi's Edge of the Everyday World Exhibition</h3>
            <p>I enjoyed learning about different typographic systems, and I like how Illustrator works.</p>
            <p>A lot of my pieces are inspired by her photographs, and determine key shapes and colours.</p>
            <br>
            <section class="container">
                <div class="posterContainer">
                    <img class="typography" src="Typography Pieces/Artboard 1.png">
                    <h4>Axial</h4>
                    <p class="caption">Axial works by anchoring sides of text according to straight lines. I went for a corner of a printed photograph appearance. I chose an earthy turquoise for the main collection on exhibition, M/E (Mother Earth).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="posterContainer">
                    <p class="caption">Lines of text emit from a focus, like rays from the sun. I shaped mine after a lense flare and kept some key words in them. This piece took the longest but was well worth it.</p>
                    <h4>Radial</h4>
                    <img class="typography" src="Typography Pieces/Artboard 2.png">
                </div>
                <div class="posterContainer">
                    <img class="typography" src="Typography Pieces/Artboard 3.png">
                    <h4>Dialational</h4>
                    <p class="caption">Words bend and rotate around a focus, like ripples from a drop of water or like layers of an onion. Mine are inspired from the first example, I imagine it as a pond during soft rain.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="posterContainer">
                    <p class="caption">A very jumbled composition that doesn't follow any specific rule in particular. I had fun stacking and using arrows, I tried to keep it legible but also varied orientations.</p>
                    <h4>Random</h4>
                    <img class="typography" src="Typography Pieces/Artboard 4.png">
                </div>
                <div class="posterContainer">
                    <img class="typography" src="Typography Pieces/Artboard 5.png">
                    <h4>Grid</h4>
                    <p class="caption">Clusters of text are aligned to intersecting lines of the x or y axis. I modelled my work to look like a leaf with its veins. I used align to emphasise some key words.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="posterContainer">
                    <p class="caption">Parts of text are put into individual groups but unlike grid don't have to be aligned. I contained mine in water droplets. The font makes it look soft despite the tails on the letters, almost retro and cartoony.</p>
                    <h4>Modular</h4>
                    <img class="typography" src="Typography Pieces/Artboard 6.png">
                </div>
                <div class="posterContainer">
                    <img class="typography" src="Typography Pieces/Artboard 7.png">
                    <h4>Transitional</h4>
                    <p class="caption">Sentences or words sit in lines that mimic movement, of air, of liquid and so on. I was inspired in particular by a couple photos in Kawauchi's Ametsuchi  collection which shows a mountain burning.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="posterContainer">
                    <p class="caption">A straight axis is picked, and then words must be centered on it to make a symmetrical shape. I was inspired by a crystal in her Illuminance collection.</p>
                    <h4>Bilateral</h4>
